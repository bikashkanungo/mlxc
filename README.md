This repository contains the .ptc files for the NNLDA, NNGGA, and NNGGA-UEG XC functionals. It also contains straightforward demonstration on how to use the files. The `demo_NNLDA.py` provides the demonstration on how to use the NNLDA functional. The `demo_NNGGA.py` provides the demonstration for both NNGGA and NNGGA-UEG functionals (one only needs to supply the appropriate .ptc file for NNGGA and NNGGA-UEG inside it).
